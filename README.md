I am a former English language teacher who has chosen to leave a life in academia for a new and exciting career as a Junior Developer. I first became interested in software development in my previous job through my role as a teaching "E-Champion", were I was tasked with researching and creating our centre's blended learning and Ed-Tech development plan. Though my initial interest was sparked by looking into the creation of e-learning materials and the development of more effective methods of online education, studying at Maker's Academy has given me the opportunity to see that the skills needed to develop successful e-learning products can be used to develop a wide array of products or projects. It is this area of using code to create viable and useful solutions for customers which I am particularly interested in exploring.



## Skills

#### Communication

Having studied in France, worked in Spain and spent the last 10 years working with people of all nationalities I am very skilled in communicating across linguistic and cultural boundaries in a variety of different contexts. I have a lot of experience in providing clear and precise instructions, in both written and oral form. I am also well versed in having difficult conversations. In addition, I completely understand the importance of discretion and data protection.


#### Delivery

I am used to working to both long-term and short-term deadlines. I am skilled in time management and prioritising key tasks. Having previously led the development of new syllabi, the marking of exams and the creation of a blended learning and Ed-Tech development plan, I understand the importance of delivering quality work to an inflexible deadline.


#### Fast Learner

Despite having limited coding experience, I was able to gain a place at the highly competitive Makers Academy Bootcamp. My progression through the course and my successful graduation indicate that I am quick to pick up new concepts and skills. The projects which I developed through out the course show how quickly I was able to pick up languages, including: Ruby, Javascript and Swift. They also demonstrate my abilities to plan, organise and create a full stack program after only four months of intensive coding experience.



## Projects

During my time learning to code I have developed projects both individually and as part of a team. My individual projects include tasks such as replicating an oyster card system in Ruby and creating a single page web app thermostat in JavaScript. My group projects include creating a full stack Air B n B replica in Javascript and a Git helper tool based on the command line. One of the projects which I am most proud of being a part of was the creation of a notes app which is designed to help students review and revise their notes through the use of multiple reminders.
