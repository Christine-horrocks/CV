I am a former English lanaguge teacher who has chosen to leave a life in academia for a new and exciting career as a Junior Developer. 




## Skills

#### Communication

#### Delivery

#### Team Work

#### Fast Learner

Despite having limited coding experiance, I was able to gain a place at the highly competative Makers Academy Bootcamp. My progression through the course and my successful graduation indicate that I am quick to pick up new concepts and skills. My final project especially demonstrates the complex code that I am able to use after only four months of intensive coding experiance.
